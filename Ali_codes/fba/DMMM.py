        INPUTS:
        ------
        community_members: 
        A list of objects of type model for each community member.
        The object organism of the moell must have the following 
        properties specified:
        gDW_per_ml: 
        Initial cell cencentration in gDW/ml in the form 
        of a dictionary where the key is the initial time
        point and the value is the initial cell concentraiton

        The following optional properties can also be provided:
        cells_per_ml: 
        Initial cell cencentration in cells/ml in the form 
        of a dictionary where the key is the initial time
        point and the value is the initial cell concentraiton

        gDW_per_cell: 
        Gram of dry weight for one cell 

        shared_compounds: 
        A list of objects of type compound containing the information
        about shared compounds. The assigned compartment for these
        compounds is 'shared', Each shared compound object must have the
        following properties specified: 
           reactant_reactions: 
           Exchange reactions of community members taking up this compound 

           product_reactions: 
           Echange reactions of community members producing this compound

           reactions: 
           reactant_reactions + product_reactions

           concentration: 
           Initial concentration in the form of a dictionary  where the key is the initial 
           time point and value is initial concentration in mM. Example: {0:0.1} 

        reactor_type: 
        Type of reactor for simulations (batch, serial_dilution, life_cycle, chemostat)

        time_range: 
        Range of the simulation time. This is a list with 
        either two or three elements.
            Two-element format: [startTime,endTime]
            Three-element format: [startTime,timeStep,endTime]. 
                                 If the time step is not given a time step of one is used

        carrying_capacity: 
        Carrying capacity for cells (in cells/ml) of the system 
        (for logistic growth) and for compounds (in mM)

        serial_dilution_params: 
        Ia needed if reactor_type is "serial_dilution". It is a dictionary
        with two keys 'dilution_factor' (e.g., 1000) and time_between_dilutions in hour

        include_death_rate_in_mu:
        If True death rate (due to random mortaility and because of depletion of limiting nutrients)
        are included in the calculation of specific growth rate (mu)

        random_mortality_percentage: 
        Percentage of biomass that dies out due to random mortality. If no value is provided
        it is set to 0.1*dt such that for it is 0.1% for dt = 1, corresponding to mu_d = 0.001 1/h 
        for dt = 1 (see self.random_mortality_percentage for details)

        store_all_fluxes: 
        If True, dynamic changes in flux of all reactions are stored 
        in the 'flux' field by setting store_opt_fluxes for fba to True.
        The default for this input is False. Note that even when the value
        of this parameter is True, dynamic changes in fluxes for reaction
        with store_flux = True are stored. 

        use_simplistic_time_update: 
        A parameter showing a simplistic time update methods should be used (True) or not. 
        The simplistic method invovles setting all negative compound concentrations to zero if 
        such a thing occurs. If this parameter is False, then the time interval is divided into 
        smaller ones to avoid zero conetrations.
        NOTE: Please also check a related parameter called redivide_time_interval, which is set internally
        NOTE: If you use a very small tiime step such as 0.01, it's reasonable to set the value of
              this parameter to True (use simplistic approach)

        lag_phase_time: 
        The lag phase time (the time during which there is no growth). Default is zero

        warnings: 
        Can be True or False shwoing whether the warnings should be writtten to the 
        screen or not

        stdout_msgs: 
        Can be True or False shwoing whether any messages should be written to the  screen

        NOTE:
        -----
        Reaction fluxes and cell concentrations (organism.cells_per_ml) in the model as well as
        shared compound concentraitons (shared_cmp.concentration) should have already been
        stored in the form of a dictionary. Keys of this dictionary are time points and 
        values are reactoin fluxes or concentraitons. This dictionary can be empty for
        fluxes at the begining but it must have one member for the other two 
        indicating the initial concentration of the shared compounds and initial cell 
        concentrations. For example, organsim.concentration = {0:10^5} or
        shared_cmp.concentraiton = [0:0.5]
