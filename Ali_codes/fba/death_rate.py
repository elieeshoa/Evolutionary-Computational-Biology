    Compute the death rate. If ms and biomass yield is not available for none of any of the limiting
    nutrients or if they could not be computed successfully, then the death rate is set to -1% of
    max biomass flux for the wild-type strain. If the max biomass flux for the wild-type is not 
    provided then the death rate is set to -0.001 (1/h). Note that the value of death rate is

    ms_biomassYield_calc: If True ms and biomass yield is calculated for nutrients with no previously
                          assigned ms and biomass_yield. 
    wildType_max_biomass: In case ms and biomass_yield for limiting nutrients are not available
